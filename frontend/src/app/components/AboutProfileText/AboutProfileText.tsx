        <p>Hey there!</p>
        <p>
        Iâ€™m Andrew, a London-based Software Developer who lives and breathes code (and probably drinks way too much coffee â˜•).
        </p>
        <p>
        By day, I play with JavaScript, working on different codebases and apps. React UIs? Backends? APIs? You name it, Iâ€™m in. In my downtime (and sometimes during coffee breaks), I share insights, write tutorials, and create content to help devs level up their skills.
        </p>
        <p>
        Iâ€™m also the brains behind this site, and I designed it from scratch using Figma. I enjoy mixing clean code with clean design, and Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to blend creativity with tech.
        </p>
        <p>I write regularly on DEV, Hashnode, and Medium, and Iâ€™m pretty active (and kinda fun) on socials, too. Come say hi, catch some tech tips, and maybe even a meme or two.</p>
        <p>
        Letâ€™s build cool stuff and make the internet a little more awesome ðŸš€
